# golearn

I think this would help to learn Go in a more fun way by building small projects. These projects cover a range of topics to help you get hands-on experience with Go.

Feel free to explore each project, dive into the code, and learn at your own pace.

## Introduction

Before diving into the projects, you might find these resources helpful for learning the basics of Go:

- **Learn Go Basics**: [Go Tutorial - W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/go/)
- **Go Installation Steps**: [Go Installation Guide](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- **Go Documentation**: [Official Go Documentation](https://golang.org/doc/)


Here's a simple example to illustrate the basic syntax of Go:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello World!")
}
```

- **Package Definition**: Defined using the package keyword.
- **Imports**: Defined using the import keyword, followed by the packages imported in quotes.
- **Function Definition**: Using the func keyword followed by curly braces.
- **Println Function**: fmt.Println is used to output/print the text inside.

### Inside Each Project Folder

Each project folder contains its own `README.md` file that provides a detailed explanation of the specific project, including its purpose, features, and usage instructions.
